## How It Works

1. Users wear the Omi wearable device and activate it with voice commands.

3. OmiSwap translates the intent into specific blockchain operations.
4. Transactions are executed on the chosen blockchain network.
5. Users receive confirmation of their completed actions in a beautiful, easy to understand UI.
